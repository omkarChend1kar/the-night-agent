UI/UX Design Philosophy: "Engineered Clarity"
The design philosophy is built directly on the "Clean Code" principles mentioned in the architecture. Just as the backend components have a "Single Responsibility," every UI element must have a single, clear purpose.

The UI is not a "dashboard" meant to impress executives; it is a precision instrument for engineers to quickly validate autonomous actions.

Core Pillars of "Engineered Clarity"
A. The Principle of Least Noise (Minimalism)
The architecture stresses "minimal, focused contracts" between modules. The UI must do the same.

Philosophy: If data doesn't aid the decision to approve or reject a fix, remove it. The UI should feel empty rather than cluttered.

Application: The "Fix Viewer" should prioritize the code diff above all else. Metadata like timestamps or agent IDs should be secondary or hidden beneath tooltips.

B. Trust Through Transparency (Human-in-the-Loop Focus)
The entire architecture hinges on Agent 3 waiting for "human approval" before merging. The UI is the critical bridge between autonomous proposal and human action.

Philosophy: The UI must prove the agent's work. It never asks the user to blindly trust it.

Application: The "confidence score" should be prominent, but clearly backed by data (e.g., "Confidence: 91% - based on stack trace match and 3 previous similar fixes"). The "Approve Merge" action must be explicit, perhaps requiring MFA confirmation as noted in the API specs, reinforcing security.

C. Dark Mode Native (The "Night" Aesthetic)
The tool is "The Night Agent" that "silently monitors". The aesthetic should reflect a tool running in the background, non-intrusively.

Philosophy: A "lights-out" interface designed for prolonged exposure in low-light engineering environments. It should feel stealthy and efficient.

Application: Deep charcoal backgrounds (not pure black) with low-contrast text for general reading. Use vibrant color only for actionable signals: Red for active anomalies, Green for proposed additions in a diff.

D. Function Over Form (SOLID UI)
Aligned with Uncle Bob's style and the "principle of least astonishment".

Philosophy: Standard engineering patterns prevail over trendy design. A Git diff should look like a Git diff. A terminal log should look like a terminal log.

Application: Use monospaced fonts for code and logs. Ensure navigation is predictable (e.g., a left-hand rail for Services/Anomalies, main content area for Fix Review).
